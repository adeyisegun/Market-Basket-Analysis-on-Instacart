# Market-Basket-Analysis-on-Instacart
While shopping on popular ecommerce websites like Amazon, you must have stumbled upon features like 'frequently Bought together' suggesting that you may like a similar product to the one you are viewing. This feature is achieved by using an unsupervised machinelearning approach called  Market Basket Analysis. Under the hood, it uses apriori algorithm. I have done a project exploring this approach. The project's objectives are:  
1. Create a detailed Exploratory analysis of the dataset created by Instacart. 
2. Find out the associations among products in the dataset and offer advise on how your findings can be applied.
Data Source: Instacart's 2017 transaction dataset with over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 users.
